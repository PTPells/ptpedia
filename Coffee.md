|[Square Mile Coffee Roasters](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/)|Single Origin|[Nyeri, Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyeri)|SL28, SL34, Ruiru 11, Batian|10 Oct 2022|I sense a pronounced "peak" of sourness in the middle of the taste that levels out into a sweet finish. A tad bit of tannic grip at the end too.|V60|Washed|
|[Home Roasted Batch #100](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit#gid=0)|Single origin|Palestina, Huila, Colombia|Pink Bourbon|29 December 2021|A sweet, chocolatey cup. Medium body. The taste is stable throughout the sip. A solid everyday morning coffee.|V60|Fully washed
|[Docecuarenta](https://docecuarenta.com/)|Single origin|[Xico, Veracruz, Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xico,_Veracruz)|Micro-Beneficio La Joya|10 October 2021|A pronounced tropical fruit-like sweetness with a toasty finish. |V60|Natural
|[Docecuarenta](https://docecuarenta.com/)|Single origin|Santa María Yucuhiti, Oaxaca, Mexico|Guadalupe Miramar|10 October 2021|Yummy notes of molasses in a blanced, creamy body. *Note: the molasses notes almost reminds me of those delicious, sugar-hardended raisisns I would sometimes find on the tops of sticky buns.*|V60|Natural
|[Passenger Coffee](https://www.passengercoffee.com/) | Single origin |Burundi, Africa |Red Bourbon, Mibirizi |24-July-2021|It finishes in a satisfyingly clean way while its complexity brings me back for more sips to try to figure it out. So far, I’ve gotten a plummy sweetness in and a milk chocolatey rich medium body. |[cold brew](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit#gid=1060292102)|Wet process
|[Hedge Coffee](https://hedge.coffee/) | Single origin |Bella Vista, Chiapas, Mexico |Bourboun, Caturra, and Catimor |6-Feb-2021|Medium body that holds a set of a complex/difficult-to-decipher earthy tones that mellow out into a dark chocoloate-like sweetness/tartness that makes me salivate after swallowing. Yum.|V60|Washed.
|[Sightglass](https://sightglasscoffee.com) | Blend |East Africa and South America|"Winter Solstice"|29-Dec-2020|Nutty and tart. A bit thinner than I typically like in a moring coffee.|V60|*Not specified*
|[States coffee ](http://www.statescoffee.com/) | Blend |*Not specified*|"Heart + Soul"|29-Dec-2020|A dark cherry-like sweetness in a smooth fully bodied coffee. Great. |V60|Washed and natural varietals.
|[States coffee ](http://www.statescoffee.com/) | Single Origin | Kenya|Gatomboya|19-Dec-2020|Bright and balanced. I'm getting orangey notes that, on the spectrum of tart <---> sweeet, are pleasantly closer to "tart." A fun morning coffee. | V60|Washed.
|[States coffee ](http://www.statescoffee.com/) | Single Origin | Guatemala/[Bourbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee)/Caturra/[Catuai](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/04/exploring-the-catuai-coffee-variety/)/Pache *[#TODO: understand what all of these mean]* | [Agaro Gera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaro) | 5-Dec-2020 | A good cold morning coffee: well-balanced, good [medium] body with tasting notes of almond and nougat. Smooth and enjoyable. I'll be trying another one of their coffees. |V60|Washed
|[Timeless Coffee Roasters ](https://timelesscoffee.com/timeless) | Single Origin | Ethiopia | [Agaro Gera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaro) | 15-Nov-2020 | A juicy start that mellows into peach-like sweetness. Medium-bodied. A solid cup, tho not memorable.|Aeropress (inverted)|Washed
|[Kahawa 1893 ](https://kahawa1893.com/) | Single Origin | Ethiopia | Guji | 17-Oct-2020 | Blueberry-like sweetness that turns into a tartness I associated with plums in the aftertaste. A good once-in-a-while kind of coffee.| V60| Natural process|
| Blue Bottle | Single Origin | Papua New Guinea | *Not sure*  | 11-Oct-2020 | Earthy and comforting, with a bit of nectarine in the finish. Silky and well-balanced, this is a wonderul morning coffee to me. It's the kind of coffee with complexity that will unravel itself over many cups without a single overpowering note that am likely tire of. | V60| *Not sure*|
| Counter Culture | Blend |  50% [Urcunina, Colombia](Urcunina, Colombia) / 50% Golondrina, Colombia | - | 27-Sep-2020 | "Sturdy" is the first adjective that comes to mind when I think about this coffee: the flavors were a bit blunt (dark Chocolate with a bit of a sweetness at the end) delivered in a well-balanced medium bodied cup. This coffee felt big to me. "Big" in so far as it's a blend that's been constructed to appeal to a large audience by way of "sanding" off the complex edges.  | V60| Washed Process|
| Maru Coffee* | Single origin |  [Agaro, Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaro) | Nano Genji (grower) | 23-May-2020 | Rich! It has a coconut oil-like richness/fattiness to it that coats my mouth and finishes with an upward, dark chocolate-like sweetness. Not like the more floral, thinner Ethiopian coffees I've had before...yum.  | Aeropress (inverted, 1m30s steep; 207° F) | Organic Washed Process|
| Andytown | Blend | | "Wind and Sea" | 25-April-2020 | Wonderfully balanced; creamy in the mouth and a bit tangy in a Strauss yogurt kind of way...need to try this one again! | Japanese-style iced coffee |
| Home roaste batch [#81](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit#gid=0) | single origin | Kenya | Othaya Gura AB |5-Apr-2020 | After three roasts, I think I've got this bean dialed. It's a balanced cup with a rich and smooth body that reminds me of coconut oil. The sourness/sweetness of the cup is enough to be noticeable without being overpowering...reminds me of a green apple without its skin.
|XELA Coffee Roasters| single origin | Honduras | Alto de Los Santos (farm) | 30 Nov 2019 | Smell: sweet and fruity; Body: medium and substantial (good for the morning); Taste: blueberry-like sweetness that finishes with the richness of carmel
| [Heart Coffee](https://www.heartroasters.com) | single origin | Kenya | Kiambu | 7 Oct 2019 |Wonderful medium body (great for a morning cup) with a grapefruit-like finish
| Home roasted | Single origin | San Jose de Lourdes, Peru | Caserio Buenos Aires | 14 Sep 2019 | Starts off bright and juicy, like biting into an apple and then gradually slides into a rich, but not too rich, dark chocolate, medium-bodied coffee
| [Café Villarías](https://cafevillarias.com) | blend (caracolillo + planchuela beans) | Chiapas, Mexico | Mezcla de la casa | 4 May 2019 | This is what I've come to want and expect from a breakfast coffee: a kind of body that weighs in my mouth just enough to appreciate it, notes that are clear (in this case dark chocolate) and knowable enough that I have the language/a framework/a place to start thinking more about it. There are also other things going on (maybe a bit of smokiness?) that create enough curiosity for me to look forward to tomorrow morning's cup to see what else unravels.|
| La Colombe | single origin | China-Yunnan | Fuyan County, Yunnan Province | 24 Nov 2018 | Smooth and balanced with a milk-chocolate sweetness. Eager to try it again to unpack what else is going on in there.|
| Blue Bottle | single origin | North Sumatra, Indonesia | *Sumatra Lake Toba Blue Batak* | 6 Nov 2018 | It's almost like each sip has "time"...it starts with a pleasant acidity that turns into sweetness and finishes with the richness and silkiness of coconut oil without being overwhelming at any point.
| Verve | single origin | Guatemala | *Santa Clara Pacamara* | October, 2018 | Subtly sharp, with just enough sweetness to make inoffensive. Good body. Drinks like a cup of coffee i could have many times, not tire of and continue to find new things to notice.
| Home roasted | single origin | Ethiopia | *Hambela Hassan* | August, 2018 | bright with body; delightful for the morning |

`*Favorite coffee at the moment`

#### Framework
Things I've foundh helpful to remember:
- First, think about whether the different "Tasting vectors" sum/work together.
- Second, work to understand the factors contributing to how the coffee tastes/feels.

Tasting vectors
- _Flavor and aftertaste_: how it tastes; the flavors that stand out.
- _Acidity_: the bright, tangy, fruity, or wine-like flavor characteristics.
- _Body_: the physical mouthfeel and texture of a coffee. The amount of oils extracted from the coffee contribute to its "thickness." This cna range from thin and watery to thick and creamy.
- _Balance_: how well the coffee's aroma, flavor, aftertaste, and body sum together.


## Roasting
[Roast tracking log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Tools
+  Roaster: [Fresh Roast SR 340](https://www.roastmasters.com/freshroast-sr340.html)
    + ~~I'd like to figure out a way to vent the exhaust outside. In our previous apartment, I'd use the vent over the range or use a cantilevered platform to position the roaster outside. In our current apartment, the window screens are a bit of a pain to remove and the range doesn't have a ventilation system.~~
    + UPDATE (29 December 2021): The apartment we're now living in has an exhaust hood above the range; [batch #100](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit#gid=0) was the first I did inside and it worked well enough to do again (the hood handled the roasting smoke without issue).
    + I value the built-in cooling cycle. It brings the beans down from temperature quickly. This has helped me be more precise with roasts as I no longer need to consider how the beans continue to roast once the roaster's power cuts off.
+  Scale: [Jennings CJ-4000 Compact Digital Weigh Scale 4000g x 0.5g](https://www.amazon.com/Jennings-CJ-4000-Compact-Digital-Adapter/dp/B004C3CAB8); modified to eliminate the beeping sound (*see [instructions](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3u9rfu/cutting_trace_on_pcb_am_i_in_the_right_spot/)*).
    + A great starter scale.
    + I'm making more cold brew these days which means making larger volume poors more quickly. It's in these cases where I've noticed the scale's slow response time to be problematic.
+  Cooling: the Fresh Roast SR 340 built-in cooling cycle.

## Brewing

### V60
+ Meta
  + Ratio (water:coffee): 15:1
  + Grind size: 17 (Baratza Encore)
+ Process
    + _Pre-pour: Readying the coffee beans_ 
        1. Start heating up water 
        2. Determine the number of cups of coffee you want to make
        3. Multiply the number of cups you determined in "Step 1" by 20. _This number will become the weight of coffee you will end up grinding and brewing._
        4. Weigh out _insert number from "Step 2"_ grams of coffee
        5. Grind coffee. _I've found success with adjusting the grinder such that it outputs fines that are around the size of table salt granules_
        6. Put the V60 on top of the container/caraffe the coffee will drip into
        7. Place the coffe filter into the V60
        8. Pour enough hot water onto the coffee filter to fully saturate it
        9. Let all of the water pass through the filter 
        10. Dump out the water. _This hot water does two things: heats up the V60 and flushes any remaining paper-y taste from the filter._
        11. Pour grounds into the damp filter that is now sitting in the V60
        12. Jiggle the V60 so the coffee grounds form a flat bed. _The "jiggling" motion I've found helpful for flattening the grounds is why I prefer using [Hario's V60 glass dripper situated in a plastic base](https://www.hario-usa.com/collections/drippers/products/v60-glass-coffee-dripper-03). Reason: I can move the dripper about witout needing to worry about the dripper and the carafee coming into contact with one another._
        13. Create a small well in the ground bed. _I use the stem/handle of a slender cyllindircal spoon. You could also use your finger ;)_
        14. Zero the scale 
        15. Woosh! Now you are ready to start brewing.

    + _First Pour_
        1. Start a stopwatch just as you start pouring
        2. Pour the water into the well you formed and then move outwards in concentric circles. _I've found I'm able to produce the smoothest and most "circular" pours when I imagine the motion originating from my shoulder rather than from, say, my wrist._
        3. Pour a total of _2x the weight of the amount of coffee you weighed out in "Step 4" above_ into the V60
        4. Let the coffee bloom/be still until the stopwatch you started in "Step 1" reaches 30-45 seconds. _This time allows for the C02 that developed – and became trapped in the coffee during the roasting process – to escape.

    + _Secound Pour_
        1. Begin your second pour just as you did your first one: pouring hot water in concentric circles until the scale reads 60% of your total desired brew weight. _Total desired brew weight = the amount of coffee you weighed in "Step 4" of the "Pre-pour" process multipled by 15. E.g. 450g of water for 30g of coffee._
        2. Weight about 15-25 seconds

    + _Third Pour_
        1. Once most of the water from the second pour has passed through the grounds, but _before_ all of the water has passed thread (read: the coffee bed is visible), begin your third pour as you did the two pours before: pouring hot water in concentric circles.
        2. For this last pour, you're going to pour 40% of the remaining water weight (or whatever ends up being the difference between the weight your scale currently reads and the total weight you calcualted in "Step 1" of the _Second Pour_ section above).
        3. Now, take the V60 off your caraffee when either of the following happens: 1) all of the hot water has passed through the beans _or_ 2) 3 minutes and 30 seconds have elapsed since you began your first pour
        4. Swirl the coffee in the caraffe. _This helps to combine all of the coffee together that will have entered the caraffee at varying points throughout the brewing process._
        5. That's it! Enjoy ^ _ ^

## Notes

### Meta
  + 4-October: To become more practiced at tasting, I'm broadening the scope of the tasting table to include any coffee I try.

### Equipment
**Fresh Roast SR 340**


### Tasting

+ I wonder if taste can have speed. Speed as in body (light = fast; heavy = slow). Speed as in tasting notes: *Do the flavors reveal themselves immediately upfront? Do the flavors change/unravel as the coffee sits in your mouth? Are they flavors you want to keep in your mouth for a while?* Chocolate, for example, is something I enjoy letting melt in my mouth, wanting to savor the small bite for as long as i can. And if there is something to tastes having "speed" – are there certain foods I prefer at different times because of how quickly or slowly they "eat" or "drink"? is there anything to preferring slower coffees in the morning? coffees that lead me to slow down, savor and appreciate?
