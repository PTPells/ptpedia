|[Passenger Coffee](https://www.passengercoffee.com/) | Single origin |Burundi, Africa |Red Bourbon, Mibirizi |24-July-2021|It finishes in a satisfyingly clean way while its complexity brings me back for more sips to try to figure it out. So far, I’ve gotten a plummy sweetness in and a milk chocolatey rich medium body. |[cold brew](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit#gid=1060292102)|Wet process
|[Hedge Coffee](https://hedge.coffee/) | Single origin |Bella Vista, Chiapas, Mexico |Bourboun, Caturra, and Catimor |6-Feb-2021|Medium body that holds a set of a complex/difficult-to-decipher earthy tones that mellow out into a dark chocoloate-like sweetness/tartness that makes me salivate after swallowing. Yum.|V60|Washed.
|[Sightglass](https://sightglasscoffee.com) | Blend |East Africa and South America|"Winter Solstice"|29-Dec-2020|Nutty and tart. A bit thinner than I typically like in a moring coffee.|V60|*Not specified*
|[States coffee ](http://www.statescoffee.com/) | Blend |*Not specified*|"Heart + Soul"|29-Dec-2020|A dark cherry-like sweetness in a smooth fully bodied coffee. Great. |V60|Washed and natural varietals.
|[States coffee ](http://www.statescoffee.com/) | Single Origin | Kenya|Gatomboya|19-Dec-2020|Bright and balanced. I'm getting orangey notes that, on the spectrum of tart <---> sweeet, are pleasantly closer to "tart." A fun morning coffee. | V60|Washed.
|[States coffee ](http://www.statescoffee.com/) | Single Origin | Guatemala/[Bourbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_coffee)/Caturra/[Catuai](https://perfectdailygrind.com/2020/04/exploring-the-catuai-coffee-variety/)/Pache *[#TODO: understand what all of these mean]* | [Agaro Gera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaro) | 5-Dec-2020 | A good cold morning coffee: well-balanced, good [medium] body with tasting notes of almond and nougat. Smooth and enjoyable. I'll be trying another one of their coffees. |V60|Washed
|[Timeless Coffee Roasters ](https://timelesscoffee.com/timeless) | Single Origin | Ethiopia | [Agaro Gera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaro) | 15-Nov-2020 | A juicy start that mellows into peach-like sweetness. Medium-bodied. A solid cup, tho not memorable.|Aeropress (inverted)|Washed
|[Kahawa 1893 ](https://kahawa1893.com/) | Single Origin | Ethiopia | Guji | 17-Oct-2020 | Blueberry-like sweetness that turns into a tartness I associated with plums in the aftertaste. A good once-in-a-while kind of coffee.| V60| Natural process|
| Blue Bottle | Single Origin | Papua New Guinea | *Not sure*  | 11-Oct-2020 | Earthy and comforting, with a bit of nectarine in the finish. Silky and well-balanced, this is a wonderul morning coffee to me. It's the kind of coffee with complexity that will unravel itself over many cups without a single overpowering note that am likely tire of. | V60| *Not sure*|
| Counter Culture | Blend |  50% [Urcunina, Colombia](Urcunina, Colombia) / 50% Golondrina, Colombia | - | 27-Sep-2020 | "Sturdy" is the first adjective that comes to mind when I think about this coffee: the flavors were a bit blunt (dark Chocolate with a bit of a sweetness at the end) delivered in a well-balanced medium bodied cup. This coffee felt big to me. "Big" in so far as it's a blend that's been constructed to appeal to a large audience by way of "sanding" off the complex edges.  | V60| Washed Process|
| Maru Coffee* | Single origin |  [Agaro, Ethiopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agaro) | Nano Genji (grower) | 23-May-2020 | Rich! It has a coconut oil-like richness/fattiness to it that coats my mouth and finishes with an upward, dark chocolate-like sweetness. Not like the more floral, thinner Ethiopian coffees I've had before...yum.  | Aeropress (inverted, 1m30s steep; 207° F) | Organic Washed Process|
| Andytown | Blend | | "Wind and Sea" | 25-April-2020 | Wonderfully balanced; creamy in the mouth and a bit tangy in a Strauss yogurt kind of way...need to try this one again! | Japanese-style iced coffee |
| Home roaste batch [#81](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit#gid=0) | single origin | Kenya | Othaya Gura AB |5-Apr-2020 | After three roasts, I think I've got this bean dialed. It's a balanced cup with a rich and smooth body that reminds me of coconut oil. The sourness/sweetness of the cup is enough to be noticeable without being overpowering...reminds me of a green apple without its skin.
|XELA Coffee Roasters| single origin | Honduras | Alto de Los Santos (farm) | 30 Nov 2019 | Smell: sweet and fruity; Body: medium and substantial (good for the morning); Taste: blueberry-like sweetness that finishes with the richness of carmel
| [Heart Coffee](https://www.heartroasters.com) | single origin | Kenya | Kiambu | 7 Oct 2019 |Wonderful medium body (great for a morning cup) with a grapefruit-like finish
| Home roasted | Single origin | San Jose de Lourdes, Peru | Caserio Buenos Aires | 14 Sep 2019 | Starts off bright and juicy, like biting into an apple and then gradually slides into a rich, but not too rich, dark chocolate, medium-bodied coffee
| [Café Villarías](https://cafevillarias.com) | blend (caracolillo + planchuela beans) | Chiapas, Mexico | Mezcla de la casa | 4 May 2019 | This is what I've come to want and expect from a breakfast coffee: a kind of body that weighs in my mouth just enough to appreciate it, notes that are clear (in this case dark chocolate) and knowable enough that I have the language/a framework/a place to start thinking more about it. There are also other things going on (maybe a bit of smokiness?) that create enough curiosity for me to look forward to tomorrow morning's cup to see what else unravels.|
| La Colombe | single origin | China-Yunnan | Fuyan County, Yunnan Province | 24 Nov 2018 | Smooth and balanced with a milk-chocolate sweetness. Eager to try it again to unpack what else is going on in there.|
| Blue Bottle | single origin | North Sumatra, Indonesia | *Sumatra Lake Toba Blue Batak* | 6 Nov 2018 | It's almost like each sip has "time"...it starts with a pleasant acidity that turns into sweetness and finishes with the richness and silkiness of coconut oil without being overwhelming at any point.
| Verve | single origin | Guatemala | *Santa Clara Pacamara* | October, 2018 | Subtly sharp, with just enough sweetness to make inoffensive. Good body. Drinks like a cup of coffee i could have many times, not tire of and continue to find new things to notice.
| Home roasted | single origin | Ethiopia | *Hambela Hassan* | August, 2018 | bright with body; delightful for the morning |

`*Favorite coffee at the moment`

#### Framework
Things I've foundh helpful to remember:
- First, think about whether the different "Tasting vectors" sum/work together.
- Second, work to understand the factors contributing to how the coffee tastes/feels.

Tasting vectors
- _Flavor and aftertaste_: how it tastes; the flavors that stand out.
- _Acidity_: the bright, tangy, fruity, or wine-like flavor characteristics.
- _Body_: the physical mouthfeel and texture of a coffee. The amount of oils extracted from the coffee contribute to its "thickness." This cna range from thin and watery to thick and creamy.
- _Balance_: how well the coffee's aroma, flavor, aftertaste, and body sum together.


## Roasting
[Roast tracking log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aH58w2qIBGqEbM_Dfpmq_KhUNhTc48ZHuMJqiuyN_lY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Tools
+  Roaster: [Fresh Roast SR 340](https://www.roastmasters.com/freshroast-sr340.html)
    + I'd like to figure out a way to vent the exhaust outside. In our previous apartment, I'd use the vent over the range or use a cantilevered platform to position the roaster outside. In our current apartment, the window screens are a bit of a pain to remove and the range doesn't have a ventilation system.
    + I value the built-in cooling cycle. It brings the beans down from temperature quickly. This has helped me be more precise with roasts as I no longer need to consider how the beans continue to roast once the roaster's power cuts off.
+  Scale: [Jennings CJ-4000 Compact Digital Weigh Scale 4000g x 0.5g](https://www.amazon.com/Jennings-CJ-4000-Compact-Digital-Adapter/dp/B004C3CAB8); modified to eliminate the beeping sound (*see [instructions](https://web.archive.org/save/https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3u9rfu/cutting_trace_on_pcb_am_i_in_the_right_spot/)*).
    + A great starter scale.
    + I'm making more cold brew these days which means making larger volume poors more quickly. It's in these cases where I've noticed the scale's slow response time to be problematic.
+  Cooling: the Fresh Roast SR 340 built-in cooling cycle.

## Notes

### Meta
  + 4-October: To become more practiced at tasting, I'm broadening the scope of the tasting table to include any coffee I try.

### Equipment
**Fresh Roast SR 340**


### Tasting

+ I wonder if taste can have speed. Speed as in body (light = fast; heavy = slow). Speed as in tasting notes: *Do the flavors reveal themselves immediately upfront? Do the flavors change/unravel as the coffee sits in your mouth? Are they flavors you want to keep in your mouth for a while?* Chocolate, for example, is something I enjoy letting melt in my mouth, wanting to savor the small bite for as long as i can. And if there is something to tastes having "speed" – are there certain foods I prefer at different times because of how quickly or slowly they "eat" or "drink"? is there anything to preferring slower coffees in the morning? coffees that lead me to slow down, savor and appreciate?
