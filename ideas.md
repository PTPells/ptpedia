## ideas

what other kinds of "items" do i accumulate?


###  meta

*things are starting to feel messy. one of the things i'm wanting is a place to represent the ongoing internal conversations i have. Said differently: ideas that i seem to contextualize new thoughts or inputs through. What I'm wanting is a place to evolve my understanding of an idea...to apply this idea and to gather references  One way I've seen this idea represented is in publishing with tagging. Tagging discrete posts with a similar tag to link them together. And while I think that's an effective way for organizing an individual's thoughts on a particular topic for an audience, I'm more so wanting a more contiguous, and thereby legible, format for capturing how my thinking about a particular idea evolves with time. The audience here is myself. An example of this might be "time" or pace." I've been thinking about this a lot recently and i'm constantly updating how i think about the idea and new intersections, but it feels like thinking is spread across many documents and I'm wanting an easier way to locate myself within the conversation.*


+ [ ]  what's a good metaphor for notes/docs/etc.? i kind of like the idea of "parking" and the time concepts that come with it (15-min, 2-hour, long term, etc.)
+ [ ]  how should private items be handled?
+ [ ]  should "pace" be represented in a document? how?
	+ by pace i'm meaning like how fast the document moves or changes. so of the documents created thus far, "ideas" would be the fastest moving because it's become kind of like a catch all.
+ [ ] how might outside collaboration work?



###  coffee roasting
#### stream
**questions to self:** *what have you noticed about the process? what would you like to improve? where do you feel like your gaps in knowledge are?*

**8/22:**  tasted the first roast of the [ethiopian beans](https://www.sweetmarias.com/ethiopia-wet-process-hambela-hassan.html); they were good*. curious to compare it with the [heart ethiopian](https://www.heartroasters.com/collections/beans/products/ethiopia-gedeb) beans i have.

\*i'm wanting a better/more nuanced way of noting tastes.

**8/21:** my intention right now is all about workflow: optimal batch weight, chaff removal, logging, cooling, etc. but roasting just twice has brought renewed focus to, what feel like, the many holes in my knowledge: developing better baseline tastes for diff. regions, identifying different roast profiles, etc. i'm eager to answer them, but more so excited that they feel almost important. "important" maybe because i immediately know where and how i'll apply their answers when i eventually arrive at them?

#### top of mind
+ **Accessibility/Inclusivity/Legibility/Participation:** something to do "consumers" changing expectations. expectations around their  role in contributing to/participating in/influencing the design/creation of the media/items they consume. as a result,  "work" that is highly referential or veiled in technical nomenclature will be seen as old and exclusionary.
+ **faith:** i don't have a specific question in mind per se...it's more that i've become interested in finding the language to articulate my own.
+ **longevity:**  is how i think about running and what i expect from it sustainable? what about my running practice do i need to maintain or change to improve my chances of being able to run comfortably for the next 40 years?
	+ *"Cold muscles don't work."* Nicolai included this manta on our run with Max last weekend in Golden Gate Park. It's remained top of mind on my five runs since and I feel a difference. Little tweaks, with outsized impact. Mindset.

#### still there, somewhere
+  **free time:**  what part(s) of peoples' days/weeks do they consider "free"? what do people expect from "free time"?
+  **improvisation:** consumption/everyday routines as acts of resistance/protest. I wonder if time fits here. The question I have in mind here is something like: *how much of each day do you feel like you have an intention for?* Or maybe this is better suited for **free time**?
+  **community:** in what new ways are people working and living together?

#### want to read
+ [Economics of Knowledge](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/economics-knowledge) by Dominique Foray

#### read
+ **[Cognitive Surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_Surplus)** *by* Clay Shirky

   Reading seven years after its publication, Shirky's optimism for a society where individuals share, collaborate and more broadly, "participate" to create public value feels fresh.* Not only fresh, but young/nascent. I believe we are just starting to tap into the idle potential that exists between people.  In this way, I'm finishing *Cognitive Surplus* feeling excited. Excited about a future where our tools think about "us" and "we."

	 \* *Am I late? Linux and Apache (read: open source software), Wikipedia and "crowdsourcing" in general has obviously been around for some time. So why does this idea feel novel to me? Am I unique in feeling this way? I'm not quite sure yet, but I'm also not sure how pressed I am for these answers.*
+ **[Siddhartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel))** *by* [Herman Hesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Hesse).
"I am not going anywhere. I am only on the way." This message resonated with me most. Sometimes when I read a book I'm not sure whether I liked the book as much as I liked the author's articulation of thoughts that had previously existed amorphously in my mind. Siddhartha fits into this category for me.
+ **[Rural Studio – Samual Mockbee and an Architecture of Decency](https://books.google.com/books/about/Rural_Studio.html?id=Cjy8Mt4hn_QC&source=kp_book_description)** *by* Andrea Oppenheimer Dean and Timothy Hursley]:
Story about what architecture can accomplish when designers fully accept their responsibility to the people their structures will protect and the environments and communities in which they will exist. Timothy Hursley's photography does a wonderful job representing this message.
+  **[Making is Connecting](https://books.google.com/books/about/Making_is_Connecting.html?id=4-X-twEACAAJ&source=kp_book_description)** *by* [David Gauntlett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gauntlett)
No revelatory moments, but an easygoing read. It incrementally advanced my internal conversation about the opportunity for creativity in everyday "operations."
